### The Team
The Hybrid Rocket team at OSU is a multi-disciplinary group of undergraduate students with the goal of researching and building a high-performance hybrid rocket.
A hybrid rocket combines solid fuel with fluid oxidizer making it safer and more controllable than a solid motor.

### The Project
My capstone team was on the launch and flight controls (LFC) subteam. 
Our mission was to design and implement a complete launch and flight control system to support the new rocket development.
Some of the high-level design requirements included:
- Remote connection to launch pad from mission control
- Controlling rocket launch sequence (oxidizer filling, ignition, etc.)
- GUI to operate/view launch sequence
- Live video monitoring of launch pad

### My Role
I was in charge of developing the embedded controller responsible for the remote link to mission control and managing the launch sequence.
