### Abstract
Hardware weekend (HWeekend) is a free 30-hour hardware development event sponsored by the College of Engineering, College of Business, and Inventors Enterprise wherein students work together in small teams to create a marketable project they can demonstrate and pitch to judges at the end of the weekend. Unlike similar events, HWeekend involves all areas of design, including mechanical, electrical, programming, and business, to bring students of all levels and majors together with industry and faculty mentors to create something new. The HWeekend event provides a unique opportunity to apply elements of gamification (such as leaderboards, achievements, etc.) to gauge its effectiveness in enhancing the learning and understanding of participants in various areas of study. Gamification is a relatively new teaching trend and this study seeks to further explore the role it could play in shaping the future of engineering education, particularly within engineering-based design events.
