My name is Quinn, I'm currently a college student finishing up my undergraduate degree. I've lived in the PNW my whole life but traveled to many places
across the country including abroad. I made this website for fun but also as a learning lesson in basic web technologies and to showcase some of my stuff.

### Education
I'm graduating from Oregon State University with Honors in March of '21 with a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

In that time I've completed two technical internships at Datalogic and Cisco as a software engineer. I have also defended my undergradute
honors thesis exploring the role of gamification in engineering education.

### Professional Interests
I love developing embedded software (C/C++, assembly) and low-level firmware - I find it very challenging yet rewarding to work at the intersection between hardware and software. This passion
fuels my interests in other related areas including computer architecture, operating systems, and high-performance computing.

Check out my projects page for some more examples of what I like to do.

### Hobbies
- Sport climbing/bouldering
- Brewing homemade kombucha
- Learning piano (slowly)
- Reading fantasy (big Brandon Sanderson fan)
- Gaming (CS:GO, Factorio, Super Smash)
